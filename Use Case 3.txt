> Use Case 3:

There is a design choice we have to make while extending the API to support future resources e.g. orders and products.
That is whether we want flat URIs for our resources or hierarchical URIs. 

I have opted for the hihierarchical URIs and my APIs would look like /cutomers/{id}/orders, /customers/{id}/orders/{id}/products.

My assumption is that a customer will have orders and orders will have products. We can access a particular order or all orders
that belongs to a particular customer. Similarly we can access a particular product ot all products that belongs to a particular 
order of a particular customer.

If our API is to be consumed in such a way that it provides access to all of the orders and all of the products irrespective of customers, 
then we can consider flat URIs and then introduce filters. For example, /orders/?customer=Steve.
